Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales

The CSV contains weekly sales data for 45 stores over approximately 2 years (from February 2010 to October 2012). Each store has around 143 entries (52 weeks/year _ 2 years + some additional weeks), totaling roughly 6,435 rows (45 stores _ 143 weeks).
Variables:
Weekly_Sales: Target variable (continuous, in dollars).
Holiday_Flag: Binary (0 or 1, indicating non-holiday or holiday weeks).
Temperature: Continuous (in Fahrenheit).
Fuel_Price: Continuous (in dollars per gallon).
CPI: Continuous (Consumer Price Index, a measure of inflation).
Unemployment: Continuous (unemployment rate in percentage).
Interpretation of Results
Holiday_Flag has the largest impact on weekly sales. Holiday weeks (e.g., Thanksgiving, Christmas) see a substantial sales spike, likely due to increased consumer spending during these periods.
CPI is the second most influential factor. Higher inflation (higher CPI) correlates with lower sales, possibly because consumers have less purchasing power as prices rise.
Unemployment also significantly impacts sales. Higher unemployment reduces consumer spending, leading to lower sales.
Temperature has a smaller, but notable, effect. Warmer weather slightly reduces sales, possibly due to seasonal shopping patterns (e.g., more sales in colder months like December).
Fuel_Price has the least impact, with a negligible and non-significant effect on sales.

üîç Analysis of Low Sales During September Holiday

Observation:
From your dot graph, you've identified a holiday in September where weekly sales are consistently low across all stores.
üìâ What this could indicate:
Customer Behavior:

This could be a non-gifting or low-shopping holiday (e.g., Labor Day in the U.S.), where people travel or stay home instead of shopping.

Consumers might already be done with their back-to-school shopping in August, leading to a natural dip in September.

Seasonal Trends:

September is a transitional month between summer and fall, which may not align with major sales promotions.

There may be inventory shifts happening, with fewer product launches and lower marketing activity.

Weather/Temperature Effects:

If your dataset includes temperature, maybe there are climate-related factors ‚Äî i.e., areas may still be hot, and seasonal items (like fall wear) haven‚Äôt picked up in demand.

Holiday Significance:

If the holiday is not gift-oriented or celebration-heavy, consumers are unlikely to spend as much.

üí° Recommendations to Increase Sales for This Holiday
Targeted Promotions:

Run Labor Day-themed sales or limited-time discounts to spark urgency.

Bundle products for early fall ‚Äî boots, jackets, school supplies, etc.

Inventory Planning:

Introduce "early fall essentials" right before the holiday to stimulate spending.

Leverage clearance or pre-season items that can ride the holiday visibility.

Marketing Strategy:

Educate customers on deals available ‚Äî perhaps they don‚Äôt associate the holiday with shopping.

Push email or SMS campaigns 1‚Äì2 weeks ahead of the holiday to build momentum.

Local Insights:

Explore if regional factors (like climate or events) also influence the dip.

Certain stores may benefit from localized campaigns based on their climate or customer base.

Analysis of Low Weekly Sales During September Holidays in Walmart Stores

1. Holiday Flag and Sales
   The dataset marks certain dates with Holiday_Flag = 1, indicating holidays. For September, the holiday dates are:
   2010: 10-09-2010
   2011: 09-09-2011
   2012: 07-09-2012
   Observation: Weekly sales during these September holidays are relatively low compared to other holiday periods (e.g., November and December holidays, which show significantly higher sales).
2. Possible Reasons for Low Sales in September Holidays
   Minor Holiday Impact:
   September holidays (e.g., Labor Day in the U.S.) are less associated with major shopping events compared to holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas. Consumers may not prioritize shopping during these holidays.
   Post-Summer Lull:
   September marks the end of summer, and back-to-school shopping peaks in August. By September, consumer spending may dip before the holiday season ramps up in November.
   Low Promotional Activity:
   Walmart may run fewer promotions or discounts in September compared to year-end holidays, leading to lower sales.
3. Temperature Analysis
   September Temperatures:
   2010: ~78.69¬∞F
   2011: ~76.00¬∞F
   2012: ~83.96¬∞F
   Impact:
   Moderate temperatures in September may not drive demand for seasonal products (e.g., winter clothing or summer items), unlike extreme temperatures in other months that boost sales of weather-sensitive goods.
4. Fuel Price Trends
   September Fuel Prices:
   2010: ~2.565
   2011: ~3.546
   2012: ~3.73
   Impact:
   Higher fuel prices in 2011 and 2012 could reduce disposable income, leading to lower spending on non-essential items. However, fuel prices alone do not fully explain the dip, as sales were also low in 2010 when fuel prices were lower.
5. CPI (Consumer Price Index) Trends
   September CPI:
   2010: ~211.495
   2011: ~215.861
   2012: ~222.439
   Impact:
   Rising CPI indicates inflation, which may reduce purchasing power. However, CPI trends are gradual and do not sharply correlate with the September holiday sales dip.
6. Unemployment Rates
   September Unemployment:
   2010: ~7.787
   2011: ~7.962
   2012: ~6.908
   Impact:
   Higher unemployment in 2010-2011 could contribute to lower consumer spending, but the trend does not fully explain the September-specific dip, as unemployment was lower in 2012.
7. Store-Specific Trends
   Some stores (e.g., Store 3 and Store 7) consistently show lower sales during September holidays, possibly due to location or demographic factors (e.g., less foot traffic in urban areas during minor holidays).
   Key Takeaways:
   Primary Reason: September holidays are not major shopping events, leading to lower sales.
   Secondary Factors:
   Moderate temperatures reduce demand for seasonal products.
   Higher fuel prices and inflation (CPI) may marginally impact spending.
   Unemployment rates show some correlation but are not the main driver.
   Recommendation: Walmart could test targeted promotions or back-to-school extensions in September to boost sales during this lull period.

Conclusion
The factors impacting Weekly_Sales the most, ranked by significance, are:
Holiday_Flag: Strongest positive impact (holidays boost sales by ~$400,000).
CPI: Strong negative impact (higher inflation reduces sales).
Unemployment: Moderate negative impact (higher unemployment reduces sales).
Temperature: Weak negative impact (warmer weather slightly reduces sales).
Fuel_Price: Negligible impact.
For actionable insights, Walmart should focus on maximizing sales during holiday weeks (e.g., through promotions) and consider strategies to mitigate the impact of high inflation and unemployment, such as offering discounts or targeting price-sensitive customers in regions with higher CPI.
